<h1>Philosophy</h1>

<p>
  EmberUI was designed to make building complex web applications simple. Web applications share a common set of components that are needed over and over again. It used to be that you would stitch together a variety of jQuery plugins of dubious quality to make your application function, but that does not lead to great experiences. There needs to be a better way.
</p>
<p>
  EmberUI tries to to be this library&mdash;a uniform set of components that can be depended on to be of very high quality and flexible in their design. Each component's feature set is carefully considered and a ton of attention is paid to the design to make it both usable and "fun".
</p>
<p>
  Because of our design-first approach EmberUI is going to be opinionated. There are some common design decisions that we no longer consider good design that will not make their way into EmberUI. For example, optgroups for selects or text inputs for date selectors.
</p>

<h3>What EmberUI is not</h3>
<p>
  EmberUI is not a CSS framework. It will not assist you in laying out or styling your application. Ambitious interfaces require creativity and CSS frameworks prevent that. Having said that you may use EmberUI in conjuction with a CSS framework.
</p>


<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>
  EmberUI uses <a href="https://github.com/joliss/broccoli">Broccoli</a> for its build process. It makes use of <em>broccoli-dist-es6-module</em> to automatically build AMD, Named AMD, and CommonJS modules. There is also a global version available. If you don't know what this is, use the global version.

  If you just want to have a look, you can check out the interactive documentation or clone <a href="http://emberjs.jsbin.com/hisogu">http://emberjs.jsbin.com/hisogu</a> and poke around

<h3>Installation</h3>

<pre>
// yourproject/bower.json
{
  {
  "name": "your-project",
  "dependencies": {
    "jquery": "^1.11.1",
    "handlebars": "2.0.0",
    "ember": "1.9.1",
    "emberui": "^0.6.0",
    "ember-cli-list-view": ">=0.0.3",
    "moment": "~2.9.0",
    "twix": "~0.6.2"
  }
}

// yourproject/package.json
"dependencies": {
  "ember-cli-velocity": "^0.2.5"
}

$ ember install
</pre>

<p>
You also need to import some of ember-ui's dependencies in your <em>Brocfile.js</em> if you aren't already using them in your project.
</p>
<pre>
app.import('bower_components/moment/moment.js');
app.import('bower_components/twix/bin/twix.js');
</pre>

<p>TODO: Add instructions for css</p>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<ul class="dependencies">
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/list-view">list-view</a>
    <p>
      An internal component uses <em>list-view</em> to incrementally render itself for peformance reasons.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://momentjs.com">moment.js</a>
    <p>
       All date components make use of <em>momentjs</em> for their functionality.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://isaaccambron.com/twix.js">twix.js</a>
    <p>
      Used to format the date ranges for the <em>selectdate</em> component.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>



<h1>Design Files</h1>

<p>
  You can use these PSDs to make mocking up layouts with EmberUI super fast. There is one PSD for each form element and it contains the element in all its possible states and variations. EmberUI is under heavy development so it is possible that not all variations shown in the PSDs are currently implemented.
